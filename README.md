## About Me

I'm Luis Camilo Gómez Rodríguez, a passionate Full Stack Developer with a background in Mathematics from the National University of Colombia. I have 1 year of experience creating RESTful API servers, implementing SOLID programming principles, and working on real-world production projects.

### Skills

**Programming Languages:** TypeScript, Python, Julia, R.

**Technologies:** Node, Express, Django, PostgreSQL, React, Git, GitHub.

**Languages:** Native Spanish, English (B1 level).

### Experience

I have experience working as a Freelance Back-end Developer for Unix Telemetry, where I built a dashboard for tracking fleet drivers' history, a registration service app with login and token authentication, and other services using JavaScript, Express.js, and MySQL.

I have also collaborated on team projects like an Online Shoe Store, where I implemented user authentication with JSON Web Tokens, backend filters, and main endpoints, as well as testing the backend endpoints using Jest.

### Projects

- **Pokemon App:** An open-source web application with a server that consumes the Pokemon API and a client that displays a long list of Pokemon with pagination, search, sorting, and filtering. Each Pokemon has its own detail view. Built with React.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize ORM.

- **Shipping Logistics Web App:** A web application for managing shipping logistics, including a user interface and an admin interface with login, third-party login, Cloudinary integration, deployment, and the same technologies used in the Video Games App (React.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize ORM).

- **Video Games App:** An open-source web application with a server that consumes the RAWG video game database API and a client that displays a long list of video games with pagination, search, sorting, and filtering. Each game has its own detail view. Built with React.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize ORM.

- **University Project:** Led a team project that built a logistics feedback model in Julia using the convex.jl library. The model included a convex problem with convex constraints based on a real-world scenario and its solution, aimed at reducing unnecessary inventory storage and transportation costs while maximizing efficiency.

I'm a highly motivated professional with a strong ability to stay focused on goals and overcome obstacles. My logical and mathematical skills allow me to contribute innovative algorithmic solutions, and my understanding of others' needs enables effective collaboration.
